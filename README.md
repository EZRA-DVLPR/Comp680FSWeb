# Comp680FSWeb

File Sharing Website

# Description

## Project Description

This project is designed to be a File Sharing Website (FSWeb) that allows users to:
- upload documents to an online storage
- we intend to add compression options based on the file type being uploaded
- download documents from the same online storage (we will be decompressing the data upon download request)

> [!Note]
> The data uploaded is visible by ANY authenticated user.
> This is not a private data storage service.

## Tech Stack

We are utilizing the MERN stack:

- MongoDB for the database
- Express.JS for the backend
- React.JS for the frontend
- Node.JS for the backend

A future development is to make the website serverless (hosted on the cloud).

## API Functionality

- Google Authentication
- ...

The "client" folder runs the frontend of the app

The "server" folder runs the backend of the app

# Installation
## NPM
run the following commands in order to set up the client and server properly.

## For client:
```
cd ./client
npm install
```

## For server:
```
cd ./server
npm install
```

Additionally, you will need to connect the server to a mongoDB database using the `.env` file.
To be more specific, you will need the `.env` to contain the variable `MONGO_URI` configured to your database with associated Username and Password.

## Docker
Install docker, add the `.env` file as mentioned before, and run
``` shell
docker compose up -d
```
This brings up containers.
