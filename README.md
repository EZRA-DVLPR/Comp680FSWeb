This project is a React-based web application that implements Firebase authentication, including sign-in mechanisms via email/password and Google OAuth. 
It utilizes Material-UI for the user interface components to ensure a responsive and modern design. 
This README provides setup instructions and additional information to help all team members get started with development in Visual Studio Code.

Select File > Open Folder... and choose the project directory.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up Firebase:
Ensure that src/firebase/firebase.js is configured with your Firebase project credentials.
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This will run the app in the development mode on http://localhost:3000.

Development Best Practices
